<h1>About FairyJS</h1>
<p>
    FairyJS is kind of framework which helps you serving rich features to your website
    visitors easily and with no hassle. By default it doesn't require you to even
    know JavaScript in order to make it working.
</p>
<p>
    The basic idea is to eliminate that tonn of JavaScript code we usually write for every project
    and just enjoy stable website work and development speed.
    FairyJS is transparent to your markup and any other things you can do with your 
    HTML. It uses data-* attributes that are valid in HTML5.
</p>
<p>
    Essentially, FairyJS is a set of "plugin" objects providing some functionality through two different
    ways:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>HTML attributes</li>
    <li>JavaScript interface</li>
</ol>
<p>
    HTML attributes are the basic way of using FairyJS and it doesn't require you to 
    write any JavaScript code. It just works.
</p>
<p>
    JavaScript interface is need to make some advanced things or when it simply cannot be done without
    some custom code (for example, drag&amp;drop cannot be done without custom reaction on drop).
</p>
<p>
    I hope you enjoy using FairyJS! FairyJS is open source and accessible on Github, so don't
    hesitate and <a href="https://github.com/zysoft/FairyJS">fork it</a>!
